"""
Each atom has list of basis functions. A basis function is defined by its
angular quantum numbers l, m and a radial function f(r). We also require a
radial cutoff r_c so that f(r) = 0 for r >= r_c. Each basis function evaluates
to f(r) * Y_lm, r being the distance from the atom's center.

We use a combined index mu, or M, to enumerate basis functions of different
atoms and l,m: mu = {a, l, m}. In practice, allowed values of m depend on l so
we mainly use a and l when grouping basis functions. The radial function and
cutoff are the same for all m that share {a, l} indices. Mu is ordered such
that first are l=0 functions of atom a=0, then l=1 funcs of a=0, etc.

Class BasisFunctionCollection describes the full set of all basis functions
phi_mu and provides methods for calculating stuff with them.
