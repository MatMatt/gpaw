/* Implements a "life support" system for Python objects, so that they remain
alive for as long as GPAW's homebrew GPU kernels are using them. Needed because
we often get pointers to existing GPU arrays as inputs from Python side and
use those pointers in kernels. But kernels are asynchronous wrt. the CPU host,
so without proper reference count management Python could destroy the arrays
while kernels are still using them. */
