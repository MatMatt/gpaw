cProfile
========

Python has a :mod:`cProfile` module to help you find the places in the
code where the time is spent.

Let's say you have a script ``script.py`` that you want to run through the
profiler.  This is what you do:

>>> import profile
>>> profile.run('import script', 'prof')

This will run your script and generate a profile in the file ``prof``.
You can also generate the profile by inserting a line like this in
your script::

    ...
    import cProfile
    cProfile.run('atoms.get_potential_energy()', 'prof')
    ...

.. note::

    Use::

        import cProfile
        from gpaw.mpi import rank
        cProfile.run('atoms.get_potential_energy()', f'prof-{rank:04}')

    if you want to run in parallel.

To analyze the results, you do this::

 >>> import pstats
 >>> pstats.Stats('prof').strip_dirs().sort_stats('time').print_stats(20)

The list shows the 20 functions where the most time is spent.  Check
the :mod:`pstats` documentation if you want to do more fancy things.

.. tip::

   Since the :mod:`cProfile` module does not time calls to C-code, it
   is a good idea to run the code in :ref:`debug mode` - this will wrap
   calls to C-code in Python functions::

     $ python3 -d script.py

.. tip::

   There is also a quick and simple way to profile a script::

     $ python3 -m cProfile script.py


Parallel profiling (GPAW new only)
==================================

The profiling of GPAW new code is done by a decorator called trace, which
is to be applied to all functions one wants to profile.
GPAW already has a lot of trace decorators added.

To keep overhead minimum when not tracing,
an environment variable called ``GPAW_TRACE`` has to be set to 1
in order to allow tracing. If ``GPAW_TRACE`` is not defined, or 0,
the trace decorator will be identity, and no overhead will be added to function calls.

In addition to setting the environment variable,
one needs to use the ``global_timer`` of ``gpaw.new``. Below are two examples
of how to profile.


CPU profiling
-------------

Here is an example how to perform CPU profiling for a particular phase of a GPAW calculation.

.. literalinclude:: profiling.py

This will write ``.json`` files for each MPI rank, and finally, at exit, it will concatenate them into a single file.
In order to visualize the profiling results go to address ``https://ui.perfetto.dev/``, click on ``Open trace file``
and open the resulting json (the concatenated one without rank number).

GPU profiling
-------------

The GPU profiling is the same as CPU profiling, but in addition, there are additional events which are tracked
in the GPU stream. This allows to trace what CPU is doing vs. what GPU is doing. For more information,
see below for the ``gpu=True`` option on trace decorator.

.. literalinclude:: gpuprofiling.py


Adding tracing to new functions
-------------------------------
The trace decorator can be imported as follows: ``from gpaw.new import trace``.

To profile a particular function one needs to decorate it as follows::

    from gpaw.new import trace
    ...
    @trace
    def my_slow_function(...):
        ...
    ...


For GPU tracing, when utilizing the GPU profiler, it is often advantageous to track when GPU is working at
particular function, instead of the CPU. To that end, the trace may be given an extra argument ``gpu=True``.
When utilized together with the GPUProfiler, this will emit GPU events to the GPU stream, and therefore
tracking the time of the beginning and end of GPU kernel launches (in the default stream). In ideal case,
the CPU will run ahead of GPU streams (because in case there is CPU intensive part, the GPU stream will catch up,
but allowing the CPU part to be cost free)::

    from gpaw.new import trace
    ...
    @trace(gpu=True)
    def my_slow_gpu_function(...):
        ...
    ...

Adding tracing inline
---------------------

If one wants to trace a set of lines which do not consist of an entire function, one may use the tracectx context manager::

    from gpaw.new import tracectx
    with tracectx('slow lines'):
        ...
