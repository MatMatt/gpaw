Part 2: Equilibrium potential of a LiFePO4/C battery
====================================================

You will calculate the equilibrium potential and use Bayesian error estimation
to quantify how sensitive the calculated equilibrium potential is towards
choice of functional. The notebook is ``batteries2.ipynb``.

* Setup and calculate :mol:`FePO_4` and :mol:`LiFePO_4` structures

  - Use these and the previous Li metal calculation to determine the
    equilibrium potential of a :mol:`FePO_4/Li` battery

* Get an uncertainty estimation on the potential by using an ensemble of
  functionals called a ``BEEFEnsemble``

* Using values from the previous day calculate the equilibrium potential of
  the full Li :mol:`FePO_4/C` battery


Day 3 - Equilibrium potential
=============================

Today you will study the :mol:`LiFePO_4` cathode.  You will calculate the
equilibrium potential and use Bayesian error estimation to quantify how
sensitive the calculated equilibrium potential is towards choice of
functional.  After today you should be able to discuss:

- The volume change during charge/discharge.

- The maximum gravimetric and volumetric energy density of a :mol:`FePO_4/C`
  battery assuming the majority of weight and volume will be given by the
  electrodes.

- Uncertainty in the calculations.

Some of calculations you will perform today will be tedious to be run in
this notebook.  You will automatically submit some calculations to the HPC
cluster directly from this notebook.  When you have to wait for
calculations to finish you can get started on addressing the bullet points
above.


:mol:`FePO_4`
=============

First we will construct an atoms object for :mol:`FePO_4`. ASE can read files
from in a large number of different
:mod:`ase:ase.io`.
However, in this case you will build it from scratch using the below
information:

    # P       5.87676435       1.46881009       0.52297232
    # Unit cell:
    #            periodic     x          y          z
    #   1. axis:    yes    9.94012    0.00000    0.00000

    #   3. axis:    yes    0.00000    0.00000    4.83157

You *can* use the cell below as a starting point.

.. code::

    fepo4 = Atoms('Fe4O...',
                  positions=[[x0, y0, z0], [x1, y1, z1], ...],
                  cell=[x, y, z],
                  pbc=[True, True, True])

Visualize the structure you have made.  Explore the different functions in
the visualizer and determine the volume of the cell (``View -> Quick Info``).

.. code::

    view(fepo4)

For better convergence of calculations you should specify initial magnetic
moments to iron.  The iron will in this structure be Fe\ `^{3+}` as it
donates two *4s* electrons and one *3d* electron to PO\ `_4^{3-}`. What is
the magnetic moment of iron?  For simplicity you should assume that
:mol:`FePO_4` is ferromagnetic.

.. code::

    for atom in fepo4:
        if atom.symbol == 'Fe':
            atom.magmom = ?

Now examine the initial magnetic moments of the system using
:meth:`ase:ase.Atoms.get_initial_magnetic_moments`.

.. code::

    magmoms = fepo4.xxx()
    print(magmoms)

Write your atoms object to file.

.. code::

    write('fepo4.traj', fepo4)

For this calculation you will use the BEEF-vdW functional developed by
`Wellendorff et al.
<https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.85.235149>`__.
Although there are better alternatives for calculating the energy of bulk
systems, the BEEF-vdW has a build-in ensemble for error estimation of
calculated energies using a statistical approach.  An ensemble is
essentially a collection of different functionals that are used to sample
the space of possible solutions.  By considering this collection one can
obtain an assessment of the uncertainty associated with the functional.
This is particularly useful in DFT calculations where the exact functional
form is not known, and different approximations can lead to varying
results.

In the set-up of this calculator you will append relevant keyword values
into a dictionary, which is fed to the calculator object.
To save computational time while keeping the calculations physically sound, the following should be used:

.. literalinclude:: fepo4.py
   :start-after: snippet-params
   :end-before: snippet-u

DFT suffers from the self-interaction error.  An electron interacts with
the system electron density, to which it contributes itself.  The error is
most pronounced for highly localized orbitals.
:ref:`Hubbard U <hubbardu>`
is used to mitigate the self-interaction error of the highly localized
*3d*-electrons of Fe.  This is done in GPAW using the ``setups`` keyword.

.. literalinclude:: fepo4.py
   :start-after: snippet-u
   :end-before: snippet-calc

Make a GPAW calculator and attach it to the atoms object.  Here you will
use :meth:`ase:ase.Atoms.get_potential_energy`
to start the calculation.

.. literalinclude:: fepo4.py
   :start-after: snippet-calc
   :end-before: snippet-beef

You will use the ensemble capability of the BEEF-vdW functional.  You will
need this later so you should write it to file so you do not have to start
all over again later.  Start by obtaining the required data from the
calculator, i.e., the individual energy of each term in the BEEF-vdW
functional expansion.  Get the energy difference compared to BEEF-vdW for
2000 ensemble functionals.

.. literalinclude:: fepo4.py
   :start-after: snippet-beef
   :end-before: snippet-ensemble

Print the energy differences to file.  This is not the most efficient way
of printing to file but can allow easier subsequent data treatment.

.. literalinclude:: fepo4.py
   :start-after: snippet-ensemble
   :end-before: snippet-2

You now have what you need to make a full script (call it ``fepo4.py``).
Submit the calculation to the HPC cluster.  The calculation should take
around 10 minutes.

.. code::

   $ mq submit fepo4.py -R 8:1h  # submits the calculation to 8 cores, 1 hour

Run the below cell to examine the status of your calculation.

.. code:: bash

   $ mq ls

Once the calculation begins, you can run the cells below to open the error
log and output of the calculation in a new window.  This can be done while
the calculation is running.

.. code::

    $ tail fepo4.py.*.err
    $ tail fepo4.py.*.out


:mol:`LiFePO_4`
===============

You will now do similar for :mol:`LiFePO_4`. In this case you will load
in a template structure called :download:`lifepo4_wo_li.traj` missing
only the Li atoms.

.. code::

    lifepo4_wo_li = read('lifepo4_wo_li.traj')

Visualize the structure.

.. code::

    view(lifepo4_wo_li)

You should now add Li into the structure using the fractional
coordinates below:

.. code::

    # Li  0    0    0
    # Li  0    0.5  0
    # Li  0.5  0.5  0.5
    # Li  0.5  0    0.5

Add Li atoms into the structure, e.g., by following the example in
this ASE tutorial:
:ref:`ase:manipulatingatoms`.
Visualize the structure with added Li.

.. code::

    view(lifepo4)

Ensure that the magnetic moments are as they should be, once again
assuming ferromagnetism for simplicity.

.. code::

    print(lifepo4.get_initial_magnetic_moments())

At this point you should save your structure by writing it to a
trajectory file.

.. code::

    write('lifepo4.traj', lifepo4)

You should now calculate the potential energy of this sytem using the
method and same calculational parameters as for :mol:`FePO_4` above.
Make a full script in the cell below similar to what you did above for
:mol:`FePO_4` and make sure that it runs.  If the code runs, submit to
the HPC cluster as you did above.  The calculation takes approximately
10 minutes.

If you instantiate the GPAW calculator like this:

.. code:: python

   calc = GPAW(txt='lifepo4.txt, **params)

then you can follow the calculation by looking at the ``lifepo4.txt``
log-file.

.. code::

   $ mq submit lifepo4.py -R 8:1h
   $ mq ls
   $ mq ls
   ...
   $ mq ls  # OK, it started running
   $ tail lifepo4.txt


Li metal
--------

We use a Li metal reference to calculate the equilibrium potential.  On
exercise day 2 you used a Li metal reference to calculate the
intercalation energy in the graphite anode.  The approach is similar
here.  Just read in the result of the calculation with DFTD3 and attach
a new calulator to it.

.. literalinclude:: li-metal.py
   :end-before: snippet-beef

Now calculate the ensemble in the same way as for :mol:`FePO_4` and
:mol:`LiFePO_4`.

.. literalinclude:: li-metal.py
   :start-after: snippet-beef


Calculate equilibrium potential and uncertainty
===============================================

You can now calculate the equilibrium potential for the case of a
:mol:`FePO_4/Li` metal battery from the intercallation energy of Li in
:mol:`FePO_4`. For simplicity, use that assumption that all vibrational
energies and entropic terms cancel each other.  You should now have
completed all submitted calculations before you proceed.

.. literalinclude:: eq_pot.py
   :start-after: snippet-read
   :end-before: snippet-read-end

The calculated energies are for the full cells.  Convert them to the
energy per formula unit.  The
:func:`len` function can be quite helpful for this.

.. code::

    epot_fepo4 = ...
    epot_lifepo4 = ...
    epot_li_metal = ...
    print(epot_fepo4, ...)

No calculate the equilibrium potential under the assumption that it is
given by `V_{eq} = \Delta U / e`, where `U` is the electronic potential
energy of the system and `e` is the number of electrons transfered.

.. code::

    # V_eq = ...

You will now calculate the error estimate for the Li intercallation
energy in :mol:`FePO_4` using the BEEF ensemble results.  Start by
loading in the files.  Wait a few minutes and rerun the cell if the
number is not 2000 for all of them.

.. literalinclude:: eq_pot.py
   :start-after: snippet-beef
   :end-before: snippet-end

Note that these are energies per cell and not per formula unit.  Convert
them as you did the potential energies above.  Note that you are now
performing the operation on a list of length 2000 and not a single float
value as before.

.. code::

    # fepo4_ens = fepo4_ens_cell / ...
    # ...
    # ...

Make a list of equilibrium potentials.

.. code::

    # V_eq_ens = lifepo4_ens - ...

Use the plot command below to visualize the distribution.

.. code::

    plt.hist(V_eq_ens, 50)
    plt.grid(True)

The result should look like this:

.. image:: eq_pot.svg

Use the :func:`numpy:numpy.std`
to obtain the standard deviation of the ensemble.

.. code::

    # error = ...
    # print(error)

The equilibrium potential for a :mol:`FePO_4/Li`
battery is thus as a good estimate:


.. code::

    print(f'{V_eq:.2f} V +- {error:.2f} V')

You can get the equilibrium potential for the :mol:`FePO_4/C` battery using
the intercallation energy of Li in graphite, that you calculated on Day
2. What equilibrium potential do you find?  How does that compare to the
cell voltage you can obtain from :mol:`FePO_4/C` batteries?

Make sure you are able to discuss the bullet points at the top of this
notebook.


Bonus
=====

How does the predicted error estimate change if you consider the full
reaction from Li in graphite + :mol:`FePO_4` to empty graphite +
:mol:`LiFePO_4`.
