===================================
Li intercalation energy in graphite
===================================

The :ref:`batteries1` page will guide you through the first day of the
battery exercise.

* Setup a graphite structure

* Calculate C-C and interlayer distances

  - Use an empirical potential and DFT with a couple of exchange correlation
    functionals and compare with experimental values

* Setup and calculate the energy of Li metal

  - Using DFT only from now on

* Setup and calculate the combined structure of Li between graphene layers

* Use all values to determine the Li intercalation energy

  - Compare the results of different functionals with experimental values.


Day 2 - Li intercalation energy
===============================

Today we will calculate the energy cost/gain associated with
intercalating a lithium atom into graphite using approaches at different
levels of theory.  After today you should be able to:

- Setup structures and do relaxations using ASE and GPAW.
- Discuss which level of theory is required to predict the
  Li intercalation energy and why?

The Li intercalation reaction is:

.. math:: Li(s) + C_x^{graphite} \rightarrow LiC_x

and the intercalation energy will then be

.. math::

  E_{Li@graphite} = E_{LiC_x} - (E_{Li(s)} + E_{C_x^{graphite}})

Where `x` is the number of Carbon atoms in your computational cell.

We will calculate these energies using Density Functional Theory (DFT)
with different exchange-correlation functionals.  Graphite is
characterised by graphene layers with strongly bound carbon atoms in
hexagonal rings and weak long-range van der Waals interactions between
the layers.

In the sections below we will calculate the lowest energy structures of
each compound.  This is needed to determine the intercalation energy.

Graphite
========

.. image:: C64.png

To try some of the methods that we are going to use we will start out by
utilizing the interatomic potential
:mod:`~ase.calculators.emt` (Effective Medium
Theory) calculator.  This will allow to quickly test some of the
optimization procedures in ASE, and ensure that the scripts do what they
are supposed to, before we move on to the more precise and time
consuming DFT calculations.  Initially we will calculate the C-C
distance and interlayer spacing in graphite in a two step procedure.

.. testcode::

    # The graphite structure is set up using a tool in ASE
    from ase.lattice.hexagonal import Graphite

    # One has only to provide the lattice constants
    structure = Graphite('C', latticeconstant={'a': 1.5, 'c': 4.0})

To verify that the structures is as expected we can check it visually.

.. testcode::

    from ase.visualize import view
    view(structure)  # This will pop up the ase gui window

Next we will use the EMT calculator to get the energy of graphite.
Remember absolute energies are not meaningful, we will only use energy
differences.

.. testcode::

    from ase.calculators.emt import EMT

    calc = EMT()
    structure.calc = calc
    energy = structure.get_potential_energy()
    print(f'Energy of graphite: {energy:.2f} eV')

.. testoutput::

    Energy of graphite: 15.84 eV

The cell below requires some input.  We set up a loop that should
calculate the energy of graphite for a series of C-C distances.

.. testcode::

    import numpy as np

    # Provide some initial guesses on the distances
    ccdist = 1.3
    layerdist = 3.7

    # We will explore distances around the initial guess
    dists = np.linspace(ccdist * .8, ccdist * 1.2, 10)
    # The resulting energies are put in the following list
    energies = []
    for cc in dists:
        # Calculate the lattice parameters a and c from the C-C distance
        # and interlayer distance, respectively
        a = cc * np.sqrt(3)
        c = 2 * layerdist

        gra = Graphite('C', latticeconstant={'a': a, 'c': c})

        # Set the calculator and attach it to the Atoms object with
        # the graphite structure
        calc = EMT()
        gra.calc = calc

        energy = gra.get_potential_energy()
        # Append results to the list
        energies.append(energy)

Determine the equilibrium lattice constant.  We use a
:mod:`numpy.polynomial`.

.. testcode::

    # Fit a polynomial:
    poly = np.polynomial.Polynomial.fit(dists, energies, 3)
    # and plot it:
    # magic: %matplotlib notebook
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1)
    ax.plot(dists, energies, '*r')
    x = np.linspace(1, 2, 100)
    ax.plot(x, poly(x))
    ax.set_xlabel('C-C distance [Ang]')
    ax.set_ylabel('energy [eV]')

.. testcode::

    poly1 = poly.deriv()
    poly1.roots()  # two extrema
    # Find the minimum:
    emin, ccdist = min((poly(d), d) for d in poly1.roots())
    print(f'C-C dist: {ccdist:.3f} Å')
    # alternatively:
    poly2 = poly1.deriv()
    for ccdist in poly1.roots():
        if poly2(ccdist) > 0:
            break
    print(f'C-C dist: {ccdist:.3f} Å')
    from pathlib import Path

.. testoutput::

    C-C dist: 1.319 Å
    C-C dist: 1.319 Å

Make a script that calculates the interlayer distance with EMT in the
cell below

.. testcode::

    # This script will calculate the energy of graphite
    # for a series of inter-layer distances.
    from ase.calculators.emt import EMT
    from ase.lattice.hexagonal import Graphite
    import numpy as np

    # ccdist is already defined in the previous cell
    # Start from a small guess
    layerdist = 2.0
    ...

Now both the optimal C-C distance and the interlayer distance is
evaluated with EMT. Try to compare with the experimental numbers provided
below.

========================= ===================== ===== ===== ===== ==========
\                          Experimental values   EMT   LDA   PBE   PBE+DFTD3
========================= ===================== ===== ===== ===== ==========
C-C distance / Å                      1.42
Interlayer distance / Å               3.35
========================= ===================== ===== ===== ===== ==========

Not surprisingly we need to use more sophisticated theory to model this
issue.  Below we will use DFT as implemented in GPAW to determine the
same parameters.

First we set up an initial guess of the structure as before.

.. literalinclude:: relax_graphite.py
   :start-after: web
   :end-before: LDA

Then we create the GPAW calculator object.  The parameters are explained
:ref:`here <parameters>`,
see especially the section regarding
:ref:`manual_mode`.
This graphite structure has a small unit cell, thus plane wave mode,
``mode=PW()``, will be faster than the grid mode, ``mode='fd'``. Plane wave
mode also lets us calculate the strain on the unit cell - useful for
optimizing the lattice parameters.

We will start by using the LDA exchange-correlation functional.  Later
you will try other functionals.

.. literalinclude:: relax_graphite.py
   :start-at: LDA
   :end-before: sf

Check out the contents of the output file (:download:`graphite-LDA.txt`),
all relevant information about the scf cycle are printed therein.

Then we optimize the unit cell of the structure.  We will take advantage
of the :class:`ase:ase.filters.StrainFilter`
class.  This allows us to simultaneously optimize both C-C distance and
interlayer distance.  We employ the
`BFGS <https://aria42.com/blog/2014/12/understanding-lbfgs>`__ algorithm to
minimize the strain on the unit cell.

.. literalinclude:: relax_graphite.py
   :start-at: sf

Read in the result of the relaxation and determine the C-C and interlayer
distances.

.. testcode::

    from ase.io import read
    import numpy as np

    atoms = read('graphite-LDA.traj')
    # or
    atoms = read('graphite-LDA.txt')
    a = atoms.cell[0, 0]
    h = atoms.cell[2, 2]
    # Determine the rest from here
    print(f'C-C: {a / np.sqrt(3):.3f} Å')
    print(f'layer-distance: {h / 2:.3f} Å')

.. testoutput::

    C-C: 1.411 Å
    layer-distance: 3.213 Å

Now we need to try a GGA type functional (e.g.  PBE) and also try to add
van der Waals forces on top of PBE (i.e.  PBE+DFTD3). These functionals
will require more computational time, thus the following might be
beneficial to read.

If the relaxation takes too long time, we can submit it to be run in
parallel on the computer cluster.  Remember we can then run different
calculations simultaneously.

Log in to the gbar terminal, save a full script in a file
(e.g. `calc.py`) and submit that file to be calculated in parallel
(e.g. ``mq submit calc.py -R 8:1h`` (1 hour on 8 cores)).

.. note::

   Read more about MyQueue here: https://myqueue.readthedocs.io/

Check the status of the calculation by ``mq ls``.

When the calculation finishes the result can be interpreted by
using the ASE :func:`~ase.io.read` function to get an atoms
object.  This assumes that the trajectory file is called:
:download:`graphite-LDA.traj`, if not change accordingly.

.. testcode::

    from ase.io import read
    # The full relaxation
    relaxation = read('graphite-LDA.traj', index=':')
    # The final image of the relaxation containing the relevant energy
    atoms = read('graphite-LDA.traj')

.. testcode::

    # Extract the relevant information from the calculation
    # Energy
    energy = atoms.get_potential_energy()

    # Unit cell
    cell = atoms.get_cell()

    # See the steps of the optimization
    from ase.visualize import view
    view(relaxation)


Li metal
========

.. image:: Li2.png

Now we need to calculate the energy of Li metal.  We will use the same
strategy as for graphite, i.e.  first determine the lattice constant,
then use the energy of that structure.  This time though you will have to
do most of the work.

Some hints:

1. The crystal structure of Li metal is shown in the image above.  That
   structure is easily created with one of the functions in the
   :mod:`ase.build` module

2. A k-point density of approximately 2.4 points / Angstrom will be sufficient

3. The DFTD3 correction is done *a posteriori*, this means the calculator
   should be created a little differently, see [the second example
   here](https://ase-lib.org/ase/calculators/dftd3.html#examples)

4. See also the :mod:`equation of state module <ase.eos>`

In the end try to compare the different functionals with experimental values:

========= ==================== ===== ===== ===========
\         Experimental values   LDA   PBE   PBE+DFTD3
========= ==================== ===== ===== ===========
a / Å                3.51
========= ==================== ===== ===== ===========


Li intercalation in graphite
============================

.. image:: C144Li18.png

Now we will calculate the intercalation of Li in graphite.  For
simplicity we will represent the graphite with only one layer.  Also try
and compare the C-C and interlayer distances to experimental values.

========================== ===================== ===== ===== ===========
\                           Experimental values   LDA   PBE   PBE+DFTD3
========================== ===================== ===== ===== ===========
C-C distance / Å                       1.441
Interlayer distance / Å                3.706
========================== ===================== ===== ===== ===========

.. testcode::

    # A little help to get you started with the combined structure
    from ase.lattice.hexagonal import Graphene
    from ase import Atom

    # We will have to optimize these distances
    ccdist = 1.40
    layerdist = 3.7

    a = ccdist * np.sqrt(3)
    c = layerdist

    # We will require a larger cell, to accomodate the Li
    Li_gra = Graphene('C', size=(2, 2, 1), latticeconstant={'a': a, 'c': c})
    # Append an Li atom on top of the graphene layer
    Li_gra.append(Atom('Li', (a / 2, ccdist / 2, layerdist / 2)))

Now calculate the intercalation energy of Li in graphite with the
following formula:

.. math::

   E_{Li@graphite} = E_{LiC_x} - (E_{Li(s)} + x * E_{C^{graphite}})

where `x` is the number of Carbon atoms in your Li intercalated graphene
cell.  Remember to adjust the energies so that the correct number of
atoms is taken into account.

These are the experimental values to compare with In the end try to
compare the different functionals with experimental values:

============================ ===================== ===== ===== ===========
\                              Experimental values   LDA   PBE   PBE+DFTD3
============================ ===================== ===== ===== ===========
Intercalation energy / eV               -0.124
============================ ===================== ===== ===== ===========

Great job!  When you have made it this far it is time to turn your
attention to the cathode.  If you have lots of time left though see if
you can handle the bonus exercise.


Bonus
=====

In the calculation of the intercalated Li we used a graphene layer with 8
Carbon atoms per unit cell.  We can actually use only 6 Carbon by
rotating the x and y cell vectors.  This structure will be faster to
calculate and still have neglible Li-Li interaction.

.. testcode::

    from ase import Atoms

    ccdist = 1.40
    layerdist = 3.7

    a = ccdist * np.sqrt(3)
    c = layerdist

    Li_gra = Atoms('C6Li')  # Fill out the positions and cell vectors
    ...
